# ADR-001: Team Structure for Microservices  

## Status  
Accepted  

## Context  
We need to establish a team structure that supports the development, deployment, and maintenance of microservices while minimizing coordination costs.  

## Decision  
We will adopt a Team Topologies approach with the following team types:  
- Stream-aligned teams (microservices teams)  
- Platform team (cloud platform)  
- Enabling team (system design team)  
- Complicated subsystem team (release team)  

## Consequences  
- Each microservice will be owned by one team  
- Teams will have clear boundaries and responsibilities  
- We need to establish interaction patterns between teams  
- We may need to adjust team boundaries as we learn more about the domain
