# API-First Design Principle  

## Overview  
API-first design means designing the API before implementing the service. This allows us to focus on the contract that the service will fulfill rather than the implementation details.  

## Guidelines  

1. **Design Before Implementation**  
   - Create and review API specifications before writing any code  
   - Use OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) to document APIs  

2. **Consumer-Oriented**  
   - Consider the needs of API consumers first  
   - Design intuitive, consistent endpoints and data models  

3. **Versioning Strategy**  
   - Plan for API evolution from the beginning  
   - Use semantic versioning in the URL path (e.g., /v1/flights)  

4. **Consistency**  
   - Follow REST principles consistently  
   - Use standard HTTP methods and status codes appropriately  
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions across all APIs  

5. **Documentation**  
   - Document all endpoints, parameters, and responses  
   - Include examples in documentation  
   - Keep documentation in sync with implementation
